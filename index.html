        Real Madrid, Spanish professional football (soccer) club based in
        Madrid. Playing in all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los
        Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known teams, with fans
        in many countries. Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team
        formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and
        joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played
        at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu
        spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened
        in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the
        venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association
        (FIFA) World Cup final.
